#  movie_recommendation_api

#### We have built a basic content based recommendation engine which recommends top 20 movies from the dataset to the user.
#### Now the recommendation system has been made into an API using Flask.
#### The input will be movie title and it returns a json array of 20 movies similar to the queried movie.
